> TCP and UDP Sockets API on Chrome, Firefox and Safari desktop browsers with extensions via native messaging.

**What?** A cross-platform, cross-browser extension for desktop browsers that injects simple & easy-to-use `UdpPeer`, `TcpServer` and `TcpClient` sockets API into page window, available in plain JavaScript.

**Why?** I was prototyping a web-based multiplayer-online game then realized that WebSocket and WebRTC standard APIs are not flexible enough to achieve custom networking solutions when needed. After that I took the challenge and decided to provide raw UDP and TCP sockets with a simple API so that people can implement their own network transport layer on top. Especially for real-time games, you'd better use thin UDP transport layer to fight with network congestion!

**How?** Using _Native Messaging_ APIs on [Chrome&nearr;](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging) and [Firefox&nearr;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging), we are exchanging messages with native host app ([Messenger](Messenger)) so it does all socket operations for us.
